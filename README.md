## What is GitHub and Why Should You Care?

**GitHub** is a website where you can store, share, and showcase your projects. Think of it as a portfolio website specifically designed for code and data projects.

### Why Data Analysts Need GitHub:
- **Build Your Portfolio**: Show potential employers your actual work, not just talk about it
- **Track Your Progress**: See how your skills improve over time
- **Collaboration**: Work with others or get feedback on your projects
- **Industry Standard**: Most tech companies expect you to have a GitHub profile

### Key Terms (Don't worry, I'll explain these in detail later):
- **Repository (Repo)**: A folder that contains your project files
- **Commit**: Saving a snapshot of your work with a description
- **README**: A document that explains what your project is about
- **Branch**: A separate version of your project where you can experiment
- **Pull Request**: A way to merge your experimental work back into the main project

## Getting Started: Your First Repository

Let's create your first repository step by step.

### Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub** at [github.com](https://github.com)
2. **Click the green "New" button** (or the "+" icon in the top right, then "New repository")
3. **Fill in the repository details**:
   - **Repository name**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `sales-data-analysis`)
   - **Description**: Write a brief one-liner about your project (e.g., "Analysis of 2024 sales data to identify top-performing products")
   - **Public or Private**: Choose "Public" so employers can see it
   - **Check "Add a README file"**: This creates a starting document for you
   - **Add .gitignore**: Select "Python" if you're using Python (this prevents unnecessary files from being uploaded)
   - **Choose a license**: Select "MIT License" (allows others to use your work with credit)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

🎉 Congratulations! You just created your first repository!

### Step 2: Understanding Your Repository Page

You'll see several tabs at the top:
- **Code**: Where all your files live
- **Issues**: For tracking bugs or tasks (we won't use this yet)
- **Pull requests**: For reviewing changes (we'll cover this later)

---

## Understanding Commits

A **commit** is like taking a snapshot of your project at a specific moment. Each commit includes:
- The changes you made
- A message explaining WHAT you changed and WHY
- The date and time
- Who made the change

### Why Commits Matter:
- They create a history of your project
- Employers can see HOW you work, not just the final result
- You can always go back to a previous version if something breaks

### How to Make Your First Commit

Let's add a file to your repository:

1. **Click "Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
2. **Name your file**: Type `data/sample.csv` (this creates a folder called "data" with a file inside, so the file is the sample.csv, i could be anything, mavenstoy.xlsx, etc... any file you upload, just name it correctly for good reference)
3. **Add some content**: Paste some sample data or text
4. **Scroll down to "Commit new file"**
5. **Write a commit message**:
   - **First line** (required): A short summary (e.g., "Add sample sales data")
   - **Description** (optional but recommended): More details (e.g., "This dataset contains 100 sales records from January 2024")
6. **Click "Commit new file"**

### Writing Good Commit Messages

**Bad commit messages:**
- "update"
- "changes"
- "fixed stuff"
- "asdfgh"

**Good commit messages:**
- "Add data cleaning script"
- "Fix calculation error in revenue column"
- "Update README with installation instructions"
- "Remove duplicate records from dataset"

**Formula for good commits:**
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, Create)
- Be specific but concise
- Explain WHAT changed, not HOW (the code shows HOW)

## Creating a Professional README

Your README is the first thing people see. It's like the cover letter of your project.

### Essential Sections for a Data Analysis README:

```markdown
# Project Title

Brief one-sentence description of your project.

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Data Source](#data-source)
- [Tools Used](#tools-used)
- [Key Findings](#key-findings)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [How to Use This Repository](#how-to-use-this-repository)

## Overview
2-3 paragraphs explaining:
- What problem you're solving
- Why this analysis matters
- What questions you're answering

## Data Source
- Where the data came from
- Date range covered

```

## How to Use This Repository
Step-by-step instructions for someone who wants to recreate your analysis.
```

### README Tips:
- **Use headers** (# for big, ## for medium, ### for small)
- **Add images**: `![Alt text](path/to/image.png)`
- **Make lists**: Use `-` or `1.` for bullet points
- **Add code blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) before and after code
- **Keep it scannable**: Use short paragraphs and white space

## Organizing Your Project Structure

A well-organized repository makes you look professional and makes your work easy to understand.

### Recommended Folder Structure for Data Analysis Projects:

```
your-project-name/
│
├── data/
│   ├── raw/                    # Original, untouched data
│   └── cleaned/                # Processed, ready-to-use data
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── 01_data_exploration.ipynb
│   ├── 02_data_cleaning.ipynb
│   └── 03_analysis.ipynb
│
├── scripts/
│   ├── cleaning.py             # Reusable cleaning functions
│   └── visualization.py        # Reusable plotting functions
│
├── visualizations/
│   ├── sales_trend.png
│   └── top_products.png
│
├── reports/
│   └── final_report.pdf        # Your final presentation or document
│
├── .gitignore                  # Files to ignore
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt            # Python packages needed
```

### Why This Structure Works:
- **Clear separation**: Raw data never gets overwritten
- **Numbered notebooks**: Shows your workflow in order
- **Reusable scripts**: Makes your code professional
- **Easy to navigate**: Anyone can find what they need quickly

### Creating Folders on GitHub Web:

You can't create empty folders on GitHub, but here's a trick:

1. **Click "Add file"** → **"Create new file"**
2. **Type the folder path**: `data/raw/.gitkeep` (the `.gitkeep` file is a placeholder)
3. **Commit the file**
4. Now you have a `data/raw/` folder!
5. Don't worry about the .gitkeep there, you can always use add file or upload files depending on what you want, to load data to your folder. Just imagine the gitkeep as a zero mb space taker but if it annoys you lol, you can delete it later.

## Branches and Pull Requests

**Branches** let you work on different versions of your project without breaking the main version. This is especially useful when you want to try something new or work on a specific feature.

### Why Use Branches?
- **Experiment safely**: Try new analysis approaches without risking your main work
- **Organize work**: Keep different phases of analysis separate
- **Professional practice**: Shows employers you understand collaboration workflows

### Simple Branch Workflow for Data Analysis:

**Main branch** = Your stable, working analysis  
**Feature branches** = Trying new things (e.g., "add-visualization", "test-new-model")

### Creating and Using a Branch:

#### Step 1: Create a New Branch

1. **Click the "main" dropdown** (top left of your code page)
2. **Type a new branch name**: Use descriptive names like `add-sales-visualization` or `clean-customer-data`
3. **Click "Create branch"**

You're now working in a separate copy of your project!

#### Step 2: Make Changes in Your Branch

1. **Edit or add files** as you normally would
2. **Write clear commit messages** for each change
3. All these commits stay in your branch only

#### Step 3: Create a Pull Request

When you're happy with your changes and want to merge them into the main branch:

1. **Click "Pull requests" tab**
2. **Click "New pull request"**
3. **Select your branch** to merge into main
4. **Add a title**: "Add sales trend visualization"
5. **Add a description**: Explain what you did and why
   ```
   ## Changes Made
   - Created line chart showing monthly sales trends
   - Added sales_trend.png to visualizations folder
   - Updated README with new visualization
   
   ## Results
   The chart clearly shows Q4 had the highest sales.
   ```
6. **Click "Create pull request"**

#### Step 4: Merge Your Pull Request

1. **Review the changes** (scroll down to see what's different)
2. **Click "Merge pull request"**
3. **Click "Confirm merge"**
4. **Delete the branch** (optional but keeps things clean)

Now your changes are in the main branch!

### When to Use Branches:

**Good use cases:**
- Adding new visualizations
- Trying different analysis methods
- Cleaning a new dataset
- Creating a report section

**You probably don't need branches for:**
- Fixing small typos
- Adding one file
- Simple README updates

## Tips for Building Your Portfolio

### Start Simple
Don't try to make your first project perfect. Start with:
- A small dataset you understand
- A simple question to answer
- Basic visualizations

### Document As You Go
Don't wait until the end to write your README. Add commits and update documentation throughout your analysis.

### Quality Over Quantity
3 well-documented projects are better than 10 messy ones. Employers care about:
- Clear thinking
- Good documentation
- Professional presentation

### Show Your Process
Don't just upload final results. Show:
- How you cleaned the data
- Why you chose certain approaches
- What challenges you faced
- How you solved problems

### Keep Learning
As you get comfortable with the basics:
- Try more complex analyses
- Learn advanced GitHub features
- Contribute to other projects
- Share your work on LinkedIn
