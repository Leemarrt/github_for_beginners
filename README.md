# github_for_beginners
A beginner-friendly guide teaching data analysts how to document projects on GitHub. I have just little experience as you. So I am in the best place to write this in a way you can implement. Don't be afraid to repeat steps you don't get immediately. But I promise, it is easier than you think. This repository is also useful to anyone finding "EASE".
