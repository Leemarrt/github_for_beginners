# Contributing to GitHub for Data Analysts

Thanks for helping! This guide is beginner-friendly and uses the **GitHub web interface** (no command line).

## How to contribute (fast path)
1. **Open an issue first**: propose your change and get a quick follow.
2. **Fork or create a branch** (web UI): `feature/short-name`.
3. **Make small, focused edits** (README, images, examples).
4. **Write clear commit messages**:
   - `Add Quick Start checklist section`
   - `Fix typo in glossary: repository`
5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**: explain what changed and why.
6. **Be kind**: follow the Code of Conduct (assume good intent, be specific, cite sources).

## What I welcome
- Clearer steps or screenshots/GIFs
- More beginner examples (Excel, Power BI, Python)
- Typos, wording, or formatting fixes
- Translations (start small: headings, glossary)
- New “common mistakes” with fixes

## Style
- Simple language, avoid jargon (or define it)
- Use relative image paths: `images/...`
- Keep sections short; add links to detail

## Getting help
- Ask in your Issue; we’ll respond as soon as we can.
